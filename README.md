# Neural Manifold Visualization

This script creates an animated visualization of neural manifolds using the Nengo framework. It simulates three spiking neurons and displays both their spike trains and the resulting trajectory in 3D space.

## Overview

The visualization consists of two main components:
1. A spike raster plot showing the firing patterns of three individual neurons
2. A 3D trajectory plot showing the neural manifold (the path traced by the combined neural activity)

## Installation

1. Create and activate a new conda environment:
```bash
conda create env create --name nengo --file env.yml
conda activate nengo
```

2. Or install the required Python packages by yourself:
```bash
pip install numpy==1.26.3
pip install nengo==4.0.0
pip install matplotlib
```

3. Install ffmpeg (for MP4 export):

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

On Conda:
```bash
conda install ffmpeg
```

## Technical Details

### Neural Network Configuration
- Uses 3 Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons
- Each neuron has a different encoding vector aligned with one axis
- Firing rates: 200-400 Hz
- Membrane time constant (tau_rc): 0.02s
- Synaptic filtering: 0.01s on input, 0.05s on output

### Input Signal
- Smooth circular trajectory in 3D space
- Frequency: 0.5 Hz
- Amplitude: 0.8
- Third dimension phase-shifted by Ï€/4

### Visualization Features
- Color-coded spike trains for each neuron
- Gradient-colored trajectory showing time progression
- Rotating 3D view for better spatial perception
- 1-second sliding window for spike raster
- Continuous looping animation

## Outputs

The script generates two animation files:
1. `neural_manifold.mp4`: High-quality video format
   - Higher quality
   - Smaller file size
   - Requires video player support
2. `neural_manifold.gif`: Animated GIF format
   - More widely compatible
   - Larger file size
   - Can be viewed in any web browser

## Customization

Key parameters that can be modified:
- `max_rates`: Adjust neuron firing rates
- `tau_rc`: Change membrane time constant
- `window`: Modify the spike raster window size
- `freq`: Adjust trajectory frequency
- `amplitude`: Change trajectory size
- FPS and bitrate for animation export
